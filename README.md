# CREDIT CARD APPROVAL SYSTEM

This project deals with the creation of a machine learning model to classify fraudalent transactions for financial institutions


## BUSINESS AND DATA UNDERSTANDING

The global financial landscape has witnessed a significant surge in electronic transactions, especially through credit cards, owing to the convenience they offer. However, this widespread usage has also led to an increase in credit card fraud incidents.In response to this, the need for advanced fraud detection and prevention systems has become paramount. As a result, there is a critical requirement for a robust Credit Card Fraud Prediction System that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance the security of electronic transactions and protect the interests of both financial institutions and consumers.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Credit card fraud poses a severe risk to the financial industry, leading to financial losses, compromised customer trust, and increased operational challenges. Traditional rule-based systems for fraud detection often fall short in recognizing evolving fraud patterns. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an intelligent system that can analyze vast amounts of transaction data in real-time, identify anomalous patterns, and accurately predict instances of credit card fraud.

## DATA WRANGLING

In this section, I did data preparation which invloved:

Checking for missing values, removing duplicates, renaming columns and dropping unnecessary columns to ensure the data is clean and suitable for analysis and modelling.
## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

I perfomed both univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns in the dataset.

Customers who complain have a very high chance of churning.
Females are more likely to churn than men
Customers with few products are more likely to churn
